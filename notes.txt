# live NodeList
NodeLists returned by node.childNodes and getElementsByXxx() apis are live which means changes to the DOM tree will be reflected in the NodeList when accessed.

In jsdom's implementation, a live NodeList is updated when item() or length is accessed but not when the [index] is accessed.
In a live NodeList iteration, you must carefully call list.update() (or just list.length) to trigger an update.
Beware that NodeList update is very expensive! When possible, prefer DOM transversal over getElementsByXxx();

If no changes will be made the the subtree, it is a good idea to iterate over an Array. 
var arr = nodeList.toArray(); //toArray() is not in the standards
var arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(nodeList);
